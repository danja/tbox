Run the docker-compose setup in project knowledge, Fuseki appears unresponsive to http calls. The logs say :
fuseki_1 | Starting Fuseki with Java options: -Xmx2048m -Xms2048m
fuseki_1 | Dataset name provided but 'no dataset' flag given
Please think deeply about how to resolve this, and/or inprove debugging facilities. Any new code, please provide as complete individual artifacts.

I would like to add a reference to a static directory from the nginx server set up by `docker-compose.yml` such that the `public/` dir of project `/home/projects/squirt` created by `/config/scripts/setup-repos.sh` via `/Dockerfile`, is served at `http://localhost:4000/squirt/`. Will this need any permissions or volume mapping changes? Please advise on the best course of action following best practices. Please give any code changes as artifacts.
