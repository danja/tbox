The goal of the tbox project is to create an intelligent agent ecosystem, including a knowledgebase, in a Docker container. It will interact with the outside world primarily through HTTP (using custom node services) and the XMPP protocol. It is intended to be used in two ways : as a development environment on a desktop computer or as an online service. Online, I plan to use a domain I control, `strandz.it`, possibly with services on subdomains eg. `xmpp.strandz.it`. I already have nginx set up on the server for routing with https support, so it's fine for the Docker container to expose regular http & xmpp ports without encryption. Locally, a priority is to be able to do selective hot code updates while leaving other services on the container, eg. fuseki and prosody live.
