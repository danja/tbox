please create a script config/scripts/setup-semem.sh which will be called after config/scripts/setup-repos.sh and will run projects/semem/start.sh as a service. It should report before calling start.sh and after to help confirm operation

Can you take the block in config/scripts/startup.sh and make it into a script config/scripts/ and modify the call in Dockerfile to start.sh to point to the new script instead
